* selectrum-pass
** Quick start
Largely based on https://github.com/ecraven/ivy-pass.

Install with =straight.el=. I would do it with =use-package=:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(use-package
     :straight (apheleia :host github :repo "levitatingorange/selectrum-pass"))
#+END_SRC

Run =M-x selectrum-pass=
